{"pages":[{"title":"Hazelcast Management Center Manual","text":"Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your cluster members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring the overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dumps from members. You can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your members with its scripting and console modules.","tags":"","url":"index.html"},{"title":"Deploying and Starting","text":"You have two options to start Hazelcast Management Center: Deploy the file mancenter-version.war on your Java application server\/container. Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line and then have the Hazelcast cluster members communicate with it. This means that your members should know the URL of the mancenter application before they start. Starting with WAR File Here are the steps. Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from hazelcast.org. The ZIP contains the mancenter-version.war file under the directory mancenter. You can directly start mancenter-version.war file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root 'mancenter' (http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter). java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter Enabling TLS\/SSL when starting with WAR file When you start Management Center from the command line, it will serve the pages unencrypted by using &quot;http&quot;, by default. To enable TLS\/SSL, use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center: -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true (default is false) -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=path to your keyStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=password for your keyStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore=path to your trustStore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword=password for your trustStore You can leave trust store and trust store password values empty to use the system JVM's own trust store. Following is an example on how to start Management Center with TLS\/SSL enabled from the command line: java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=\/some\/dir\/selfsigned.jks -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar mancenter-3.8.2.war You can access Management Center from the following HTTPS URL on port 8443: https:\/\/localhost:8443\/mancenter To override the HTTPS port, you can give it as the second argument when starting Management Center. For example: java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=\/dir\/to\/certificate.jks -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar mancenter-3.8.2.war 80 443 mancenter This will start Management Center on HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 with context path \/mancenter. Note that accessing port 80 with an http:\/\/ prefix will redirect the users to an https:\/\/ URL on port 443. It means that the users will use HTTPS regardless of the version of the URL they use. Excluding Specific TLS\/SSL Protocols When you enable TLS on the Management Center, it will support the clients connecting with any of the TLS\/SSL protocols that the JVM supports by default. In order to disable specific protocols, you need to set the -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols command line argument to a comma separated list of protocols to be excluded from the list of supported protocols. For example, to allow only TLSv1.2, you need to add the following command line argument when starting the Management Center: -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols=SSLv3,SSLv2Hello,TLSv1,TLSv1.1 When you specify the above argument, you should see a line similar to the following in the Management Center log: 2017-06-21 12:35:54.856:INFO:oejus.SslContextFactory:Enabled Protocols [TLSv1.2] of [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2] Starting with an Extra Classpath You can also start the Management Center with an extra classpath entry (for example, when using JAAS authentication) by using the following command: java -cp &quot;mancenter-*version*.war:\/path\/to\/an\/extra.jar&quot; Launcher 8080 mancenter On Windows, the command becomes as follows (semicolon instead of colon): java -cp &quot;mancenter-*version*.war;\/path\/to\/an\/extra.jar&quot; Launcher 8080 mancenter Starting with Scripts Optionally, you can use the scripts startManCenter.bat or startManCenter.sh located in the directory mancenter to start the Management Center. Deploying to Application Server Or, instead of starting at the command line, you can deploy it to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). If you have deployed mancenter-*version*.war in your already-SSL-enabled web container, configure hazelcast.xml as follows. &lt;management-center enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; https:\/\/localhost:sslPortNumber\/mancenter &lt;\/management-center&gt; If you are using an untrusted certificate for your container, which you created yourself, you need to add that certificate to your JVM first. Download the certificate from the browser, after this you can add it to JVM as follows. keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias &lt;AliasName&gt; -file &lt;certificateFile&gt; -keystore $JAVA_HOME\/jre\/lib\/security\/cacerts -storepass &lt;Password&gt; Launching to Management Center After you perform the above steps, make sure that http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter is up. Configure your Hazelcast members by adding the URL of your web application to your hazelcast.xml. Hazelcast members will send their states to this URL. &lt;management-center enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter &lt;\/management-center&gt; Now you can start your Hazelcast cluster, browse to http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter and setup your administrator account explained in the next section. Configuring Update Interval You can set a frequency (in seconds) for which Management Center will take information from the Hazelcast cluster, using the element update-interval as shown below. update-interval is optional and its default value is 3 seconds. &lt;management-center enabled=&quot;true&quot; update-interval=&quot;3&quot;&gt; http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter &lt;\/management-center&gt;","tags":"","url":"Deploying_and_Starting.html"},{"title":"Getting Started","text":"If you have the open source edition of Hazelcast, Management Center can be used for at most 2 members in the cluster. To use it for more members, you need to have either a Management Center license, Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license or Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD license. This license should be entered within the Management Center as described in the following paragraphs. NOTE: Even if you have a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise or Enterprise HD license key and you set it as explained in the Setting the License Key section, you still need to enter this same license within the Management Center. Please see the following paragraphs to learn how you can enter your license. Once you browse to http:\/\/localhost:8080\/mancenter and since you are going to use Management Center for the first time, the following dialog box appears.

If you want to update your settings afterwards, you need to update ldap.properties file and click &quot;Reload Security Config&quot; button on the login page. Password Encryption By default, the password that you use in LDAP configuration is saved on the ldap.properties file in clear text. This might pose a security risk. To store the LDAP password in encrypted form, we offer the following two options: Provide a KeyStore password: This will create and manage a Java KeyStore under the Management Center home directory. The LDAP password will be stored in this KeyStore in encrypted form. Configure an external Java KeyStore: This will use an existing Java KeyStore. This option might also be used to store the password in an HSM that provides a Java KeyStore API. When you do either, the LDAP password you enter on the initial configuration UI dialog will be stored in encrypted form in a Java KeyStore instead of the ldap.properties file. Providing a Master Key for Encryption There are two ways to provide a master key for encryption: If you deploy Management Center on an application server, you need to set MC_KEYSTORE_PASS environment variable before starting Management Center. This option is less secure. You should clear the environment variable once you make sure you can log in with your LDAP credentials to minimize the security risk. If you're starting Management Center from the command line, you can start it with -Dhazelcast.mc.askKeyStorePassword. Management Center will ask for the KeyStore password upon start and use it as a password for the KeyStore it creates. This option is more secure as it only stores the KeyStore password in the memory. By default, Management Center will create a Java KeyStore file under the Management Center home directory with the name mancenter.jceks. You can change the location of this file by using the -Dhazelcast.mc.keyStore.path=\/path\/to\/keyStore.jceks JVM argument. Configuring an External Java KeyStore If you don't want Management Center to create a KeyStore for you and use an existing one that you've created before (or an HSM), set the following JVM arguments when starting Management Center: -Dhazelcast.mc.useExistingKeyStore=true: Enables use of an existing KeyStore. -Dhazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.path=\/path\/to\/existing\/keyStore.jceks: Path to the KeyStore. You do not have to set it if you use an HSM. -Dhazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.pass=somepass: Password for the KeyStore. You do not have to set it if HSM provides another means to unlock HSM. -Dhazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.type=JCEKS: Type of the KeyStore. -Dhazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.provider=com.yourprovider.MyProvider: Provider of the KeyStore. Leave empty to use the system provider. Specify the class name of your HSM's java.security.Provider implementation if you use an HSM. NOTE: *Make sure your KeyStore supports storing SecretKeys. * Updating Encrypted Passwords You can use one of the updateLdapPassword.sh or updateLdapPassword.bat scripts to update the encrypted LDAP password stored in the KeyStore. It will ask for information about the KeyStore such as its location and password. It will then ask for the new LDAP password that you want to use. After updating the LDAP password, you'll need to click Reload Security Configuration button on the main screen.","tags":"","url":"LDAP_Authentication.html"},{"title":"User Interface Overview","text":"Once the page is loaded after selecting a cluster, the tool's home page appears as shown below.

It gives an overview of the connected cluster. The following subsections describe each portion of the page. CPU Utilization This part of the page provides load and utilization information for the CPUs for each cluster member, as shown below. The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the system load averages on each member for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. These average values are calculated as the sum of the count of runnable entities running on and queued to the available CPUs averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. This calculation is operating system specific, typically a damped time-dependent average. If system load average is not available, these columns show negative values. The last column (Chart) graphically shows the recent load on the CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a chart, you can see the CPU load at the time where the cursor is placed. Charts under this column shows the CPU loads approximately for the last 2 minutes. If recent CPU load is not available, you will see a negative value. Memory Utilization This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each member, as shown below. The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next columns show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage, in real-time. The Max column lists the maximum memory capacity of each member and the Percent column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (Chart) shows the memory usage of members graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes. Memory Distribution This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. The blue area is the memory used by maps. The dark yellow area is the memory used by both non-Hazelcast entities and all Hazelcast entities except the map (i.e. the memory used by all entities subtracted by the memory used by map). The green area is the free memory out of the whole cluster`s memory capacity. In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by placing the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free. Map Memory Distribution This part is the breakdown of the blue area shown in the Memory Distribution graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps. In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by map1 and 49.55% is used by map2. Partition Distribution This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each cluster member has, as shown below. You can see each member's partition percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the member &quot;127.0.0.1:5708&quot; has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see the hazelcast.partition.count property explained in the System Properties section).","tags":"","url":"Home_Page.html"},{"title":"Monitoring Caches","text":"You can monitor your caches' metrics by clicking the cache name listed on the left panel under Caches menu item.

Once you select a member from the menu, a new tab for monitoring that member opens on the right, as shown below. The CPU Utilization chart shows the percentage of CPU usage on the selected member. The Memory Utilization chart shows the memory usage on the selected member with three different metrics (maximum, used and total memory). You can open both of these charts as separate windows using the button placed at top right of each chart; this gives you a clearer view of the chart. The window titled Partitions shows which partitions are assigned to the selected member. Runtime is a dynamically updated window tab showing the processor number, the start and up times, and the maximum, total and free memory sizes of the selected member. These values are collected from the default MXBeans provided by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs and some explanations are below: Number of Processors: Number of processors available to the member (JVM). Start Time: Start time of the member (JVM) in milliseconds. Up Time: Uptime of the member (JVM) in milliseconds Maximum Memory: Maximum amount of memory that the member (JVM) will attempt to use. Free Memory: Amount of free memory in the member (JVM). Used Heap Memory: Amount of used memory in bytes. Max Heap Memory: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management. Used Non-Heap Memory: Amount of used memory in bytes. Max Non-Heap Memory: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management. Total Loaded Classes: Total number of classes that have been loaded since the member (JVM) has started execution. Current Loaded Classes: Number of classes that are currently loaded in the member (JVM). Total Unloaded Classes: Total number of classes unloaded since the member (JVM) has started execution. Total Thread Count: Total number of threads created and also started since the member (JVM) started. Active Thread Count: Current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads. Peak Thread Count: Peak live thread count since the member (JVM) started or peak was reset. Daemon Thread Count: Current number of live daemon threads. OS: Free Physical Memory: Amount of free physical memory in bytes. OS: Committed Virtual Memory: Amount of virtual memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process in bytes. OS: Total Physical Memory: Total amount of physical memory in bytes. OS: Free Swap Space: Amount of free swap space in bytes. Swap space is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. OS: Total Swap Space: Total amount of swap space in bytes. OS: Maximum File Descriptor Count: Maximum number of file descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system. OS: Open File Descriptor Count: Number of open file descriptors. OS: Process CPU Time: CPU time used by the process on which the member (JVM) is running in nanoseconds. OS: Process CPU Load: Recent CPU usage for the member (JVM) process. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the member (JVM) process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the member (JVM) 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the member (JVM) include the application threads as well as the member (JVM) internal threads. OS: System Load Average: System load average for the last minute. The system load average is the average over a period of time of this sum: (the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors) + (the number of runnable entities running on the available processors). The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific but it is typically a damped time-dependent average. OS: System CPU Load: Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed.
